#  Blood Donation Tracking System

This project is a **C++ based Blood Donation Tracking System** developed as part of my early university coursework to practice **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts and file-based data management.

The system allows managing **donors, patients, and blood stock** through a structured and modular design.

---

##  Project Scenario

The application simulates a simple blood donation system used in a hospital or blood bank environment.

- **Donors** can register, donate blood, and have their donation history recorded.
- **Patients** can be registered and managed within the system.
- **Administrators** are responsible for managing blood stock, donor information, and patient records.

The system ensures donor eligibility checks and maintains blood group stock levels accordingly.

##  Features

- Donor registration and information management
- Blood donation tracking
- Donor eligibility checking
- Blood stock management by blood group
- Patient registration and login
- Admin login and system control
- File-based data storage for donors and patients

---

##  Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling (TXT files)
- Console-based application
- Modular class design

---

##  System Design

The project is structured using multiple classes, each responsible for a specific role:

### 🔹 Donor
- Stores donor personal information and blood group
- Tracks donation count and eligibility
- Records donation details to files

### 🔹 BloodBank
- Manages blood stock for different blood groups
- Updates, adds, and deletes blood stock information

### 🔹 Admin
- Controls system operations
- Manages blood stock
- Handles patient registration and login

### 🔹 Patient
- Stores and manages patient information
- Supports registration and authentication

---

##  Project Structure

The project consists of multiple `.cpp` and `.h` files including:

- Donor, Patient, Admin class implementations
- BloodBank management classes
- File handling logic
- Test and main execution files

Each class is separated into header and source files to maintain **clean and modular code structure**.

---

##  Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience in:

- Designing object-oriented systems in C++
- Working with class relationships and encapsulation
- Using file I/O for persistent data storage
- Building modular and maintainable code
- Simulating real-world system workflows

##  Notes

This project represents my **early-stage programming experience** and is preserved to demonstrate my foundational knowledge in C++ and object-oriented software design.
